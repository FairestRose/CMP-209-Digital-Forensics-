Year 2 Term 2 - Digital Forensics 

You are to undertake the completion of the court report in self-organised groups of 3 or 4 members. 

• Each member of the group should hand in a copy of the court report. 

• The names of the group members must appear on the front of the court report. 

• The same grade will normally be awarded to all members of a group, but you must clearly identify which group members performed which bits of the investigation and wrote which bits of the report. 

In your capacity as a digital forensic investigator, you have been summoned to the home of John Doe where you are required to seize any computer equipment and investigate it. It is suspected that the computer contains illicit materials. For the purpose of this assignment, you should assume that any material of an ornithological nature is illicit.
